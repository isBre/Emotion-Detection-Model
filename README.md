# Emotion-Detection-Model
Create a Emotion Detection model, able to recognise the emotion expressed in a given text/sentence.

The **dataset** is composed of 58k texts labelled manually to assign them an emotion among the ones defined by Paul Ekman(Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness and Surprise) with the addition of the neutral class for the texts without emotions. The data provided are already split into train, test and dev(validation).
